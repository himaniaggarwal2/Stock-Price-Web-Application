# Stock Price App
This is a simple stock price web application created using *Streamlit* Library and *yfinance* in Python.

Here we are representing

1. Historical data on ticker
2. Stock price at the end of the "period" mentioned.
3. How many shares were traded in the given "period".
4. Company information
5. Company Calendar
6. Broker Recommendation

Here specifically I Have worked with Stock Pricing of **Boeing Company** names as *BA*.You can work with any one you wish for.

Also I have used a very convenient Python Library called ***yfinance***.
